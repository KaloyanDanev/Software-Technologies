                    <h2>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
                    <p>
                            Optimizing performance and TCO for one specific database or application is nice, but what most IT organizations are driving toward is a way to standardize how these benefits are delivered across the data center. Oracle, Microsoft, and SAP have all been offering strategies to standardize within their own field of vision. Take Oracle’s “engineered systems,” for example. Oracle applies standardization vertically and promises optimized levels of IT performance and IT productivity—at least for a part of IT. That doesn’t mean that standardization is a compromise—it just means that standardization needs to be broadly applied to be effective for all business-critical applications. A vertically integrated approach for a specific database, custom-written application, or one vendor’s stack is not easily leveraged across a virtual cloud computing environment, and several customers have found they have become locked in and can’t leverage best-of-breed technologies that could make their organizations more efficient and flexible, and avoid the single-vendor lock-in problem.
